 abstract = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

@article{Ribeiro2022,
 abstract = {Within the context of Industry 4.0, quality assessment procedures using data-driven techniques are becoming more critical due to the generation of massive amounts of production data. In this paper, we address the detection of abnormal screw tightening processes, which is a key industrial task. Since labeling is costly, requiring a manual effort, we focus on unsupervised detection approaches. In particular, we assume a computationally light low-dimensional problem formulation based on angle–torque pairs. Our work is focused on two unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms: isolation forest (IForest) and a deep learning autoencoder (AE). Several computational experiments were held by assuming distinct datasets and a realistic rolling window evaluation procedure. First, we compared the two ML algorithms with two other methods, a local outlier factor method and a supervised Random Forest, on older data related with two production days collected in November 2020. Since competitive results were obtained, during a second stage, we further compared the AE and IForest methods by adopting a more recent and larger dataset (from February to March 2021, totaling 26.9 million observations and related to three distinct assembled products). Both anomaly detection methods obtained an excellent quality class discrimination (higher than 90%) under a realistic rolling window with several training and testing updates. Turning to the computational effort, the AE is much lighter than the IForest for training (around 2.7 times faster) and inference (requiring 3.0 times less computation). This AE property is valuable within this industrial domain since it tends to generate big data. Finally, using the anomaly detection estimates, we developed an interactive visualization tool that provides explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) knowledge for the human operators, helping them to better identify the angle–torque regions associated with screw tightening failures.},
